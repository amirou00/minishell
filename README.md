# minishell
This is a very small version of what an actual linux shell is (also called "minishell").
It is incomplete for now, but by the time it is fully finished, is should be able to execute basic instructions and bash commands.
As you can see, it has multiple parts : the .h file which is the hader file, the minishell.c file which does most of the heavy lifting and contains all the necessary functions, and the main.c file. There is also a makefile to help out with the compilation, with some extra flags to help out with the debugging.
